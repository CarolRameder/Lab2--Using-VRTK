# Using-VRTK
Introduction to mixed realities 2nd lab

We created a demo with VRTK, in which we can grab a piece of chalk and draw with it by moving .
Right click is used to either grab or release the chalk, and left click to draw forms or a 
straight line further from the previous point . For drawing the line we used LineRenderer available in Unity .
